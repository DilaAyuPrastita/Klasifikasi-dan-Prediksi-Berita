**KLASIFIKASI KATEGORI BERITA BRITISH BROADCASTING CORPORATION (BBC) MENGGUNAKAN METODE RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK (RNN) DAN NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER**


This project aims to develop a BBC news classification model and compare the performance of two algorithms, namely Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Naive Bayes Classifier, in predicting news categories.

The classification process utilizes the TF-IDF technique for text representation and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a dimensionality reduction step. RNN is used to capture sequential relationships within the text, while Naive Bayes employs a probabilistic approach for classification. The comparison evaluates the accuracy, efficiency, and capability of each method in managing complex news data.

This project provides insights into the most effective algorithm for automatic text classification, particularly on the BBC news dataset.
